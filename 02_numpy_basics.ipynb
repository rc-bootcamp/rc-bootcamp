    "NumPy addresses performance limitations of Python that make many scientific computations impractical in pure Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which enables for rapid development and flexibility.\n",
    "However, compared with compiled languages such as C or Java (whose code is translated to machine code in advance), Python is substantially slower for many numerical workloads.\n",
    "For example, [a benchmark enumerating prime numbers](https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#primes) shows Python can be more than 30× slower than optimized C++ implementations (see the linked benchmark).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Python relatively slow?\n",
    "Several factors contribute: it can't exploit compiler optimizations the way compiled languages can, and its dynamic typing requires runtime type inspection and method dispatch.\n",
    "For instance, even a simple expression like `a + b` typically involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Checking whether a implements the operation `+`.\n",
    "2. Looking up the function that performs addition for `a`.\n",
    "3. Verifying that `b` is compatible with that operation.\n",
    "4. Extracting the values and computing the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "These runtime checks and dispatch steps add measurable overhead.\n",
    "By contrast, statically typed languages resolve such operations at compile time, avoiding much of this cost and enabling faster execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy allows Python programs to take advantage of the performance benefits of statically typed, compiled code.\n",
    "Its computational kernels are implemented in C (with parts written in C++ and Fortran), and it relies on optimized linear-algebra libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK. As a result, operations such as matrix multiplication achieve high performance."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "One might wonder why numerical code is not simply written directly in C or another statically typed language.\n",
    "For most practitioners, especially beginners, that is not the most productive choice.\n",
    "Libraries such as NumPy already incorporate extensive optimizations and domain expertise.\n",
    "Reimplementing these features without comparable expertise is rarely efficient.\n",
    "For example, a naive C implementation of [matrix multiplication](https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#matmul) (three nested loops) can be orders of magnitude slower than a tuned library call such as NumPy's `np.dot`, due to missing algorithmic and low-level optimizations.\n",
    "Consequently, researchers and engineers typically focus on higher-level problems rather than low-level optimization tasks (see the [*reinventing the wheel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel#Related_phrases) article).\n",
    "In recent years, the AI and machine-learning communities have standardized on delegating low-level numerical computation to optimized libraries while using Python's flexibility for rapid prototyping and experimentation."

    "Lastly, here are two tips for coding with NumPy before we move on to the exercise:\n",
    "1. Avoid using `for` loops whenever possible.\n",
    "2. Be mindful of array element types.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, try to avoid `for` loops.\n",
    "Each Python-level operation incurs overhead due to dynamic type checking.\n",
    "Therefore, using `for` loops slows down the process proportionally to the number of iterations.\n",
    "Instead, strive to complete operations on NumPy arrays whenever possible.\n",
    "In fact, most problems in the exercise section can be solved without resorting to `for` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, pay attention to the types of array elements.\n",
    "NumPy achieves high performance by ensuring that all elements share the same fixed data type.\n",
    "Using unsupported or mixed types can significantly degrade performance.\n",
