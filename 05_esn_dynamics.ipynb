    "Above, we described a method for calculating the Lyapunov spectrum using the Jacobian when the evolution rule $f$ of the dynamical system is known.\n",
    "However, there are cases where $f$ is known but deriving its Jacobian is not straightforward.\n",
    "This often happens when dealing with complex physical simulations.\n",
    "In such cases, the maximum Lyapunov exponent can still be calculated without deriving the Jacobian.\n",
    "Here, we introduce one such method: the **Shimada-Nagashima method**<sup>[4, 5]</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to measure the average rate of separation between two nearby trajectories per time step.\n",
    "Since the trajectories will drift apart over time, the method includes a step where one trajectory is moved back to the vicinity of the other at each time step.\n",
    "The specific procedure is as follows:\n",
    "1. Start with a point $x[k]$ on the attractor that you want to investigate.\n",
    "2. Select a nearby point $y[k]$, separated by a small distance $d_0$.\n",
    "3. Advance both trajectories by one timestep and obtain $x[k+1], \\; y[k+1]$.\n",
    "4. Calculate the distance between the two new points, $d_1 = ||x[k+1] - y[k+1]||_2$.\n",
    "5. Evaluate the logarithmic rate of separation, $\\lambda[k] = \\ln{ \\left| \\frac{d_1}{d_0} \\right|}$.\n",
    "6. Select a new point $\\tilde{y}[k+1]$ on the line connecting $x[k+1]$ and $y[k+1]$, such that its distance from $x[k+1]$ is $d_0$.\n",
    "Specifically,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\tilde{y} = x + \\frac{d_0}{d_1}(y - x)\n",
    ".\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "7. Repeat steps 3-6 to obtain the time average $\\bar{\\lambda}$ of $\\lambda[k]$.\n",
    "This $\\bar{\\lambda}$ is an approximation of the maximum Lyapunov exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this algorithm computes the maximum Lyapunov exponent is that the two trajectories diverge most rapidly along the direction of the maximum exponent.\n",
    "If the small perturbation $\\delta [k] = y[k] - x[k]$ introduced in step 2 is sampled randomly, it will generally contain components corresponding to all exponents.\n",
    "However, since distances grow or shrink exponentially, the operations in steps 3-6 will cause the component corresponding to the maximum Lyapunov exponent to dominate over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are calculating a time average, the washout operation discussed in the previous chapter is also effective for computing the Lyapunov exponent.\n",
    "In other words, since the Lyapunov exponent is defined as the average rate of expansion/contraction of trajectories on the attractor in phase space, removing the initial transient trajectories until reaching the attractor through washout leads to faster convergence."

    "However, when Gaussian noise is provided as input, it loses its chaotic nature due to noise-induced order.\n",
