    "Python is widely used because it offers a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries for data analysis and machine learning.\n",
    "In particular, Python is popular in the reservoir computing (RC) community and in AI and machine learning research due to powerful libraries such as NumPy and PyTorch.\n",
    "Additionally, Python's simple syntax and fewer pitfalls make it easier for beginners to learn and to translate code to other languages.\n",

    "When learning a programming language and implementing code with it, it is important to understand both **syntax** and **algorithms**.\n",
    "Syntax refers to the rules for writing programs, which is similar to grammar in natural languages.\n",
    "If a program contains incorrect syntax, it will not run and will raise a syntax error.\n",
    "While many basic structures are shared among languages, each language has its own conventions.\n",
    "In addition to syntax, you must understand and design algorithms, which are step-by-step procedures for solving problems.\n",
    "Although this tutorial cannot cover every algorithmic topic, we recommend reading a basic algorithms textbook since it will be useful in other contexts (Cf. [Common materials for the lecture \"Introduction to Algorithms\", Faculty of Liberal Arts, University of Tokyo](https://lecture.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/JOHZU/joho-kagaku/)).\n",
    "In summary, this chapter focuses on understanding Python syntax through fill-in-the-blank problems.\n",
    "Later chapters will cover important algorithms and their implementations in the context of RC."

    "Let's briefly introduce the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its important feature called a class.\n",
    "OOP is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects rather than solely procedures (i.e., functions or subroutines) to organize code and improve understandability.\n",
    "More technically, a class is a template (or abstract data type) that describes the structure of stored data (i.e., *fields* and *member variables*) and the processing related to those variables (i.e., *methods* and *member functions*).\n",
    "Based on this template, each created variable is called an *instance*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us demonstrate the usefulness of OOP with an example.\n",
    "Suppose we define the XYZ coordinates of vectors p and q in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as two tuples `(a, b, c)` and `(d, e, f)`.\n",
    "A function that calculates the sum vector p + q can be simply expressed as follows:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def plus(a, b, c, d, e, f):\n",
    "    return (a + d, b + e, c + f)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Although this code works correctly, it can easily become messy as the number of variables increases or the processing becomes more complex, which can lead to bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the code can be made much simpler when designed using OOP.\n",
    "For example, as shown in the later fill-in-the-blank questions, you can simply write `p + q` in the code by defining an appropriate class (e.g., `Euclidean`) with an overridden addition operator and creating instances `p` and `q` that hold `(a, b, c)` and `(d, e, f)` as their member variables, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, OOP allows you to reduce reliance on global variables by encapsulating variables within classes, a concept commonly referred to as *encapsulation*, which is one of the key features of OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the concept of OOP and its effectiveness."
